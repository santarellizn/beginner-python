#I Guess That I Have to Explain How Python Works to You Scrubs
##Variables
If you don't know how to use variables you're just a casual and you shouldn't be here.

###Assigning

This is what a variable looks like

```
variable = 1
```
That was pretty simple huh? Maybe not for your brain, filthy casual.

###Using

You use variables all the time, for example a function. But you don't know what that is so ill make it simple.

```
variable = 10
print variable
```
That will print the number 10. Hopefully that will be easy to understand, you filthy scrub.

###Types

Variables can either be strings, integers, boolean statements, or floating point integers.

##Conditionals

###Expressions

An expression in python is created with the keywords and, or, not, or is. Expressions compare one value to another and return a result in response. Here is an example of a boolean expression.
```
True = True
```
In this instance, the expression would return true.

###Branching
One of the prominent methods of branching expressions used in python is the if statement. Here is an example.
```
if variable = 1:
  example code
```
In this example, if the variable is equal to 1, it will run the example code. This example code can be anything you need to complete your task.

The else statement is also an expression and is used in conjunction with the if statement
```
if variable = 1:
  example code
  else:
    other code
```
If the variable is not equal to one, the other code would run instead of the example code, at least in this example.
##Methods
A method is something that you do in order to accomplish a task. For example, if the task was to see if the variable a is greater than variable a, you could implement a method in order to accomplish this.
```
a = 1
b = 2

if a > b:
  return True
  else:
    return False
```
This method solves the problem efficiently and allows you to accomplish the task.
