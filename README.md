#I Guess That I Have to Explain How Python Works to You Scrubs
##Variables
If you don't know how to use variables you're just a casual and you shouldn't be here.

###Assigning

This is what a variable looks like

```
variable = 1
```
That was pretty simple huh? Maybe not for your brain, filthy casual.

###Using

You use variables all the time, for example a function. But you don't know what that is so ill make it simple.

```
variable = 10
print variable
```
That will print the number 10. Hopefully that will be easy to understand, you filthy scrub.
